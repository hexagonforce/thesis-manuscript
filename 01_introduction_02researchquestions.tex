\section{Research Questions}

In this study, we investigate the performance of QoS provisioning algorithms over different network topologies, especially in live network topologies from the ITZ. We aim to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How well do Class-based Queuing QoS techniques perform under different network topologies?
    \item How do distributed QoS and core-enforced QoS differ in performance in the different topologies?
    \item Which QoS techniques exhibit the best performance in the different network topology tested?
\end{enumerate}
