\section{Research Objectives}

The main objective of this study is to analyze Class-based QoS algorithm performance in various network topologies. To achieve this, we modify the aforementioned framework which has been written to generalize layers in a fat-tree topology to generalize for a general graph topology. In that process, we expect to find some differences in network behavior and they can be quantified. Hence, we have the following specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Modify the framework by Regencia and Yu to easily simulate various network topologies and QoS algorithms in those topologies,
    \item Analyze performance of QoS Techniques in different network topology with synthetic traffic load,
    \item And find differences in behavior of the different network topologies, quantify them, and resolve issues that might arise from those differences.
\end{enumerate}
