	doi = {10.1109/ICCACS.2015.7361345},
	abstract = {Today, Wireless Mesh Networks has been recognized as a new attractive communication paradigm due to their ease of deployment and ability of fault tolerance. WMN is a multi-hop wireless network which builds high performance infrastructure and provides efficient communication using various Routing Protocols. Traditional routing protocols like AODV, DSR and DSDV etc. support Ad-hoc networking in which devices doesn't have capability to provide fault tolerance. To overcome this, several types of Opportunistic based routing protocols have been proposed i.e. EXOR, SOAR etc. which support combination of both Ad-hoc and Mesh networking. Both EXOR and SOAR exploit the broadcast nature and provide the capability of fault tolerance using multiple alternate paths and redundant copies of data packets. However, these proposed approaches have some disadvantages. To overcome this, we have proposed Fault Tolerance Based Routing (FTR) approach which adopts the concept of minimum spanning tree that provides minimum cost path for reliable packet transmission. Further, we have shown the comparative performance analysis of FTR over previously proposed approaches i.e. EXOR and SOAR using various network parameters i.e. network throughput, robustness (against node/link failure), hop count, packet size, bandwidth consumption and traffic congestion for multiple different nodes network.},

	abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides a flexible framework for service composition. Using standard-based protocols (such as SOAP and WSDL), composite services can be constructed by integrating atomic services developed independently. Algorithms are needed to select service components with various QoS levels according to some application-dependent performance requirements. We design a broker-based architecture to facilitate the selection of QoS-based services. The objective of service selection is to maximize an application-specific utility function under the end-to-end QoS constraints. The problem is modeled in two ways: the combinatorial model and the graph model. The combinatorial model defines the problem as a multidimension multichoice 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP). The graph model defines the problem as a multiconstraint optimal path (MCOP) problem. Efficient heuristic algorithms for service processes of different composition structures are presented in this article and their performances are studied by simulations. We also compare the pros and cons between the two models.},

However, presently, its architecture and infrastructures are inflexible to meet the demand of increased QoS requirements. OpenFlow, OF-Config (OpenFlow Configuration and Management protocol), and OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database Management protocol) protocols are well-known software defined networking (SDN) technologies for the Future Internet, enabling flexibility by decoupling the control plane from networking devices. In this paper, we propose a QoS framework using the SDN technologies and test the framework in failure-conditions using single and multiple autonomous system scenarios of the current Internet. We show that an effectively high QoS can be achieved for business customers using our framework.},

Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

	abstract = {A variety of communication networks, such as industrial communication systems, have to provide strict delay guarantees to the carried flows. Fast and close to optimal quality of service (QoS) routing algorithms, e.g., delay-constrained leastcost (DCLC) routing algorithms, are required for routing flows in such networks with strict delay requirements. The emerging software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm centralizes the network control in SDN controllers that can centrally execute QoS routing algorithms. A wide range of QoS routing algorithms have been proposed in the literature and examined in individual studies. However, a comprehensive evaluation framework and quantitative comparison of QoS routing algorithms that can serve as a basis for selecting and further advancing QoS routing in SDN networks is missing in the literature. This makes it difficult to select the most appropriate QoS routing algorithm for a particular use case, e.g., for SDN controlled industrial communications. We close this gap in the literature by conducting a comprehensive up-to-date survey of centralized QoS routing algorithms. We introduce a novel four-dimensional (4D) evaluation framework for QoS routing algorithms, whereby the 4D correspond to the type of topology, two forms of scalability of a topology, and the tightness of the delay constraint. We implemented 26 selected DCLC algorithms and compared their runtime and cost inefficiency within the 4D evaluation framework. While the main conclusion of this evaluation is that the best algorithm depends on the specific sub-space of the 4D space that is targeted, we identify two algorithms, namely Lagrange relaxation-based aggregated cost (LARAC) and search space reduction delay-cost-constrained routing (SSR+DCCR), that perform very well in most of the 4D evaluation space.},

We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too},

In this paper, we extend a previous framework that simulated a fat-tree topology software defined network under QoS provisioning techniques to support different topologies, including data from the Internet Topology Zoo. We compare round-trip times between each server and client, and transfer rates of HTTP traffic in the tree, mesh, and topology provided by Kreonet and Uni-C under a distributed class-based queuing system. We observe that while round-trip times are not significantly different, transfer rate of HTTP traffic as generated by ApacheBenchmark in Kreonet decreased 57.1109\% from the fat-tree topology, and 49.5328\% from the mesh topology. Uni-C topology took 114.9\% more time for the switches in the network to have installed all their flows than the Kreonet topology, the next slowest topology. Uni-C topology also failed to finish the HTTP benchmarks due to its more complex topology in a resource-limited machine. These differences demonstrate that the complexity of real world network environments (i.e. route loops, layering, convergence times) affect the network behavior, which is key to a good simulator. Therefore, the modified framework is able to support and properly simulate real-world network topologies.},
