	abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture ({SOA}) provides a flexible framework for service composition. Using standard-based protocols (such as {SOAP} and {WSDL}), composite services can be constructed by integrating atomic services developed independently. Algorithms are needed to select service components with various {QoS} levels according to some application-dependent performance requirements. We design a broker-based architecture to facilitate the selection of {QoS}-based services. The objective of service selection is to maximize an application-specific utility function under the end-to-end {QoS} constraints. The problem is modeled in two ways: the combinatorial model and the graph model. The combinatorial model defines the problem as a multidimension multichoice 0-1 knapsack problem ({MMKP}). The graph model defines the problem as a multiconstraint optimal path ({MCOP}) problem. Efficient heuristic algorithms for service processes of different composition structures are presented in this article and their performances are studied by simulations. We also compare the pros and cons between the two models.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCACS.2015.7361345},
	abstract = {Today, Wireless Mesh Networks has been recognized as a new attractive communication paradigm due to their ease of deployment and ability of fault tolerance. {WMN} is a multi-hop wireless network which builds high performance infrastructure and provides efficient communication using various Routing Protocols. Traditional routing protocols like {AODV}, {DSR} and {DSDV} etc. support Ad-hoc networking in which devices doesn't have capability to provide fault tolerance. To overcome this, several types of Opportunistic based routing protocols have been proposed i.e. {EXOR}, {SOAR} etc. which support combination of both Ad-hoc and Mesh networking. Both {EXOR} and {SOAR} exploit the broadcast nature and provide the capability of fault tolerance using multiple alternate paths and redundant copies of data packets. However, these proposed approaches have some disadvantages. To overcome this, we have proposed Fault Tolerance Based Routing ({FTR}) approach which adopts the concept of minimum spanning tree that provides minimum cost path for reliable packet transmission. Further, we have shown the comparative performance analysis of {FTR} over previously proposed approaches i.e. {EXOR} and {SOAR} using various network parameters i.e. network throughput, robustness (against node/link failure), hop count, packet size, bandwidth consumption and traffic congestion for multiple different nodes network.},

Sophisticated classification, marking, policing, and shaping operations need only be implemented at network boundaries or hosts. Network resources are allocated to traffic streams by service provisioning policies which govern how traffic is marked and conditioned upon entry to a differentiated services-capable network, and how that traffic is forwarded within that network.

	shorttitle = {Unicast {QoS} Routing Algorithms for {SDN}},
	abstract = {A variety of communication networks, such as industrial communication systems, have to provide strict delay guarantees to the carried flows. Fast and close to optimal quality of service ({QoS}) routing algorithms, e.g., delay-constrained leastcost ({DCLC}) routing algorithms, are required for routing flows in such networks with strict delay requirements. The emerging software-defined networking ({SDN}) paradigm centralizes the network control in {SDN} controllers that can centrally execute {QoS} routing algorithms. A wide range of {QoS} routing algorithms have been proposed in the literature and examined in individual studies. However, a comprehensive evaluation framework and quantitative comparison of {QoS} routing algorithms that can serve as a basis for selecting and further advancing {QoS} routing in {SDN} networks is missing in the literature. This makes it difficult to select the most appropriate {QoS} routing algorithm for a particular use case, e.g., for {SDN} controlled industrial communications. We close this gap in the literature by conducting a comprehensive up-to-date survey of centralized {QoS} routing algorithms. We introduce a novel four-dimensional (4D) evaluation framework for {QoS} routing algorithms, whereby the 4D correspond to the type of topology, two forms of scalability of a topology, and the tightness of the delay constraint. We implemented 26 selected {DCLC} algorithms and compared their runtime and cost inefficiency within the 4D evaluation framework. While the main conclusion of this evaluation is that the best algorithm depends on the specific sub-space of the 4D space that is targeted, we identify two algorithms, namely Lagrange relaxation-based aggregated cost ({LARAC}) and search space reduction delay-cost-constrained routing ({SSR}+{DCCR}), that perform very well in most of the 4D evaluation space.},

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-{DNA}, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to {DNA} damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},
