\chapter{CONCLUSION}



The following improvements to this research will help us understand better the behavior of the QoS algorithms in different networks.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Increase the number of servers and the variety of traffic.
    \item Incorporate PCAP into this research to simulate real-life traffic better
    \item Use different path-resolution algorithms other than STP
    \item Increase the scale, both in the size of the network and the number of clients
    \item Use more algorithms aside from Simple CBQ and Source CBQ.
\end{enumerate}
