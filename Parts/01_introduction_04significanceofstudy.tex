\section{Significance of the Study}

This is an extension of the framework introduced by Regencia and Yu in testing QoS algorithms. Since network infrastructure is varied across different places and applications, testing QoS provisioning techniques over various topology will provide better insight to how the techniques perform in real-life contexts. Results of this research can further enable research into finding better QoS routing and queuing techniques by identifying the characteristics of each technique over different topologies. The framework for analyzing various network topologies can be further used in network design and testing new algorithms. Finally, the research will allow network providers to implement better techniques for QoS in providing resource-intensive and critical network traffic such as video conferencing and video-on-demand.
