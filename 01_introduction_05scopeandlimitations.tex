\section{Scope and Limitations of the Study}

We test the following topologies in the research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fat tree with fanout of 3 and 2 layers,
    \item Hypercube with 8 Openflow switches,
    \item Complete mesh network with 5 Openflow switches,
    \item Networks from data provided by the Internet Topology Zoo.
\end{itemize}

For networks from data provided by the Internet Topology Zoo, We select regional and country-level data with at most 40 nodes to ensure that we have sufficient computing resources for the simulation under the heavy synthetic simulations that will be maintained from the previous study. There are 133 topologies with 40 nodes or less, out of 212 regional/country level data. 

Only the topology connecting the clients will be changed from the study by Regencia and Yu. The network traffic tested will be HTTP requests for images and PDF files, and video-on-demand through the VLC Media Player server and client.
    
We also limit the tested QoS algorithms to the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic Class-Based Queuing, leaf-enforced
    \item Basic Class-Based Queuing, core-enforced
    \item Source Class-Based Queuing, leaf-enforced
    \item Source Class-Based Queuing, core-enforced
\end{itemize}

In testing the topology from the Internet Topology Zoo, we assume that all connections are the same, because metadata on the links between the nodes are not present for all nodes.
